# Animal Competition
## Summary of Game
This game is a **two player game**. The player selects two animals to fight it out. Once the animals are selected, the program randomly selects an environment that the animals will fight in. The environments *include beach, desert, and a volcano.*  
  
With the adjusted attributes of the animals, they start to fight each other. Eventually, **a winner will be declared**, and the game is over. You can keep trying to rematch against the animal to see if  you will get any different results.
## How To Play
### Choosing An Animal
So you may be wondering, how do I play this game? Well, I am here to help! To start the game, all you need to do is input two animals into the two provided text fields. Make sure when you are inputting your chosen animals that they are valid options. If you look below the text fields, you can see all the options you can choose between.  
  
  While looking at the choices, you might have noticed a special animal called "custom". For more information about this animal, I would recommend looking at the customAnimal.md document.
  ### Gameplay
  Once you have successfully chosen your animals, a new frame will open. On this frame you will two health bars. You can tell which health bar is which by looking to the right of them. If one of the animals reaches 0 HP then the duel stops, and a winner is declared at the bottom of the screen.   
    
  From there you can either have the animals rematch, by clicking the rematch button. You can select new animals, by clicking the back button. You can also exit the game if you are done with the program.
    
  *What Is HP?*
  
 HP stands for Health Points. Health Points turns the health of an animal into a point system. That way, if an animal attacks another animal, the overall health points decrease.
